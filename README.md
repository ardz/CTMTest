# CTMTest
Notes:

-Built using 2015 Version of Visual Studio

-Requires the Specflow Extension for Visual Studio to be installed (tests are all written in Gherkin)

-Ensure the TestConfig.xml file is setup to be copied to build output (should be by default)

-To change the browser the tests run with, update the TestConfig.xml in the TestPlan

-Only tested with Firefox and Chrome (no ie/edge installation on my machine)

-Usually I would include some sort of logging class in a test framework but didn't have time to write one

-Have tried to add as many comments as possible to help clarify thought process/code layout choices
